# CHERRY BLOSSOM, LITTLE WOLF: Upcoming Sakura Kinomoto & Syaoran Li Shrine README

I just created a Git repository of my entire site so everyone can see how I'm working on it and how I plan to make it work. This README serves as a "news and updates" section before I actually start the production period.

## News & Updates
- **[4/16/16]** Added a tentative test site host for [tutorial purposes](http://ninpojineous.adrimarie.us/category/projects/cblw/) - [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com).
- **[4/10/16]** Added tentative navigation menu sections.
- **[4/5/16]** Re-created a new Git repository on [GitHub](http://github.com/adriculous/kinoli) because Hugo would not install the fresh files in my already existing folder. It said that the directory should be empty. I copied/pasted the old README.md file to this new one. In addition, I made a few changes within the planned content of the shrine.
- **[4/3/16]** Added more to the README.md for [Amassment](http://amassment.org) review/suggestions.
- **[4/2/16]** I wrote this README.md file. That's about it.


## Proposed Barebones
The following are what I'm going to use to build this shrine. It will take awhile because this is also a learning process, in which I'm putting what I've learned from online classes to actual practice. I think using it on a personal hobby site is the best way to do it.

- URL location - *http://sakusyao.lets-volt.in*
- Test site hosting - [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)
- Materialize CSS for the overall skeleton layout.
- Hugo - static site generator. Because Hugo is built using Go, which is also the same language that Google's Material Design structure was built, I think it would be a perfect combination with layouts/themes built using Materialize CSS. If not, I'll probably just built the site manually.
- PHP includes or regular HTML? I'm a bit skeptical with using PHP includes after Hugo generates all of the required HTML files. On the other hand, by using Hugo, I wouldn't be doing so much manual coding.
- Google Fonts (obviously) with *some* premium fonts if needed. Definitely script or handwritten fonts.
- Minimal images if possible. Use official images from the original manga, anime screenshots, old CCS artbooks (think [Fair Use Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use)), any old official material. AVOID wallpapers (unless if official art is used) and fanart at all costs!! (requires permission and may also cause copyright infringement)

### Why am I (re)building a Sakura Kinomoto & Syaoran Li Shrine? Didn't you have one before?

I did, back in the early 2000s and an attempted one a few years ago. Both of them were called **_Cherry Blossom, Little Wolf_** and are both dedicated to the fast-growing Sakura & Syaoran fanfiction, whether they're hosted on [FanfictionNET](http://fanfiction.net) or somewhere else. The second attempt of this site was more of a progress blog regarding my own Sakura & Syaoran fanfics, but instead, I integrated it with my general writing site at [Adri Mars](http://adrimars.me).

Most important reason: On May 1996, the CCS manga series was first published and premiered to the masses in Japan. As of this writing, it's April 2016. When we hit May, CCS will be 20 years old and I would like to commemorate it with this shrine.

After a quick review with [Amassment](http://amassment.org), the new site will still remain with the same old name: **_Cherry Blossom, Little Wolf_**.

### Why are you putting your entire site in your GitHub?

In that way, it would help me track down the past things that I've made before I made any changes, just in case I mess up. And of course, I'd like to use it as an example that anyone can build a shrine using CSS Frameworks and static site generators (if I ever go to that route). Besides, my laptop is running out of HD space and my external HD is as messy as it is, so I think it's better if I can just keep track of the changes, etc. via GitHub so it's easier to refer back to the old stuff before I made the changes. That's one of the reasons why I got a GitHub in the first place. It's hard to get used to because I need some knowledge of the command line/console, but still very worth it.

### Weren't you writing your first tutorial on your new site, The NINPOJineous?

I am also writing this repository README file to practice writing using Markdown. You notice how the extension of this file is ".md"?

## Tentative Navigation Menu
- About (this site, the series, why I built it, short mini-bio)
- Heroes (character profiles)
- Commentaries (essays and stuff about the characters)
- Features (coming soon)
- Contact
- Exits

## Tentative Content Outline

**The General Layout** One page or multiple pages? Will it actually become a shrine or an SxS fanfic collection, being collected from various sites? Not sure yet. There will also be two navigation menus, one at the top and one at the bottom. I'm not gonna use the old *prev. index. next* Javascript mini-breadcrumbs like most shrines always do because I believe users can go to any other section of the site in any order they would like. Sometimes me as a visitor would visit a shrine and then look at their "Exits" section first. I'm weird like that, I know.

#### On the Home/Main Page
- Introduction Message (second to the last step before the "Exits" section)
- Blog format news & updates (both for the site and also for the CCS 20th Anniversary Project as stated in official news all around the net)

#### About
- Info about the site
- Info about the series (it's 2016, meaning that _Card Captor Sakura_ is 20 years old from its first manga publication!! Yes, I AM that old!!)
- But Sakura and Syaoran also appeared again in a new series, _Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle_ (and its sequel, _Tsubasa World Chronicle_). Why not talk about them from that series in this shrine?
- Some mini-info about me

#### Profiles
- Info about Sakura Kinomoto
- Info about Syaoran Li

#### Commentaries
- An essay or two about their relationship
- A few essays about their relationships with the other characters
- Why I love Sakura and Syaoran? (and a look back from 20 years ago to this year)
- The differences between Sakura and Syaoran from the two series: _Card Captor Sakura_ and _Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle_ (and the newest one, _Tsubasa World Chronicle_)
- The differences between the manga and the anime
- What is this "CCS Project" that Japan has been raving about to commemorate the series' 20-year Anniversary? (maybe will go in the "news & updates" at the home page)

#### Goodies, Extras, Features, etc. (optional?)
- If I have time, maybe I'll make some pixel art of them or... something. ^^
- Avoiding wallpapers and fanart, etc. There's plenty of (stolen?) them all over the net. (sigh) It's also a hassle to FIND the names of these fan artists, let alone finding CONTACT information for them to ask permission to use their work. Better not use them at all and go with something else. In addition to wallpapers, I don't have time to make them myself because of the hectic life outside the net.
- Maybe an appreciation clique for the pair. If possible, maybe add a unique feature that would make the clique special.
- Manga scans? (probably not, mainly because there's so many of them around, plus I'm too lazy to scan. My scanner is in my brother's room, which is downstairs from my room. Although I can access it via WiFi, it's a pain for me to go back up and down just to scan them. Bleh!) I heard that the CCS Omnibus has better quality pages than the old Tokyopop manga that I currently have, except now, my married sister took them with her when she and her husband to their new home (even though it has a sticker label that has my name on them). And then, there's also the Kindle version... hmm... Kindle...
- Fanfics collective again? That was how the first edition of my old Sakura x Syaoran site was like - [Cherry Blossom, Little Wolf (Wayback Machine)](http://web.archive.org/web/20030303120009/http://kinomoto.nu/cblw/index2.html). I dunno, we'll see.

#### Contact
- Contact form, a few social media links here and there.
- I promise myself never to get lazy, so I will make some buttons and banners as diligently as I can. I'm a little imtimidated in asking other people to make me buttons/banners. >.<

#### Exits
- Links to official sites (including CLAMP's official website), as well as online shops where CCS manga and related books are available for purchase.
- Links to other great anime/manga shrines and collectives.
- If I'm able to, links to other CCS (and maybe Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle) shrines and fansites (besides the fanlistings).
- Link to [Let's Volt IN!](http://lets-volt.in)
