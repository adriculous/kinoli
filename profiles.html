               <p>Because this shrine is dedicated to Sakura &amp; Syaoran from CCS, all the info indicated in the profiles all come from the CCS manga, and probably some from the anime series. In addition, the anime has <em>extended</em> the storyline with its fillers to a few segments different to that of the story that CLAMP originally intended that it can become a little complicated to determine which one of the facts below are canon or not.</p>
               <p>When the upcoming manga this summer (2016) comes out in Japan, and if I do end up acquiring it, the profiles section would be updated. Therefore, here's a reminder: this entire site contains spoilers. Also, please take note that everything written here are coming from a long-time fan's point of view. Just check out Wikipedia and various CCS Wiki sites for more details about the characters, events, and more.</p>

                         <strong>TV Series First Appearance</strong>: Episode 1 (both <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> and <em>Cardcaptors</em>)
                         </p>
                      <span class="card-title pink-text text-darken-3">The Basics</span>      
                      <p>Sakura is your average 10-year-old girl filled with energy, spunk, athleticism, and, to the eyes of the few, oozing with cuteness that you can't help but to get giddy when you're with her. A loyal friend who can be dense, clumsy, and naive at times, she shows the values of friendship to everyone, regardless of their feelings for her, and at the same time, learns from others too. She discovered the Clow Book at her father's basement den and opened it by accident (?), releasing all the Clow Cards out the window (except for one, The Windy Card) and awakening the book's guardian, <strong>Cerberus</strong> (Kero/Kero-chan). Trying to uncover the mystery of Sakura being able to open the book, Kero chooses her to be a Card Captor to capture and return all of the cards scattered around Tomoeda. With the help and aid of her very wealthy and resourceful best friend (and cousin), <strong>Tomoyo Daidouji</strong>, Sakura becomes a Card Captor in secret, battling the powers of the cards using her wit, athleticism, and eventually, her growing magic, to capture them and become her own.</p>
                      <p>Unlike most magical girl series, Sakura dons several different types of costumes, courtesy of Tomoyo's sewing and fashion designing skills. In addition, Tomoyo documents (almost) every card capturing mission through her handy camcorder, which helps Sakura and Kero learn more about the secrets of the Clow Cards and the powers and abilities they could do for future missions. As she continues to capture the cards, the more her magic becomes more powerful, but at the same time, the card capturing missions become a lot more difficult and complex that eventually, she would need more allies than ever.</p>
                      <p>She lives in a modest home with her archaeologist and university professor father, <strong>Fujitaka</strong>, and her seventeen-year-old brother, <strong>Touya</strong>. His mother, <strong>Nadeshiko</strong>, passed away when Sakura was at a very young age, therefore she never really had the chance to get to know more of her mother. Tomoyo's mother, Sonomi, is Nadeshiko's cousin, which makes them second cousins, although Sakura was unaware of their blood relations with each other in the first place. She also has a great-grandfather, <strong>Masaki Amamiya</strong>, who took care of both Nadeshiko and Sonomi when they were young.</p>
                      <p>Sakura gets along with everyone she encounters, even though a few of them may dislike her from the beginning. Still, she is able to win the hearts of everyone through her kindness, friendship, and more. Her sweet-natured personality can easily win the hearts of others, especially the one who considers her an enemy and a rival over the Clow Cards in the beginning (<strong>Syaoran Li</strong>). She can also be mean and harsh, especially with her older brother Touya, who often teases her a lot (typical big brother to the younger sibling). She also has a little-girl crush on <strong>Yukito Tsukishiro</strong>, her brother's best friend. She is not afraid of any danger that comes near her, but thanks Touya, she is, ironically, afraid of ghosts.</p>

                         <strong>TV Series First Appearance</strong>: Episode 8 (both <em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em> and <em>Cardcaptors</em>)
                         </p>
                         <span class="card-title green-text text-darken-3">The Basics</span>
                         <p>Syaoran (ahem, Li) is, in short, everything that Sakura is not. He is the complete opposite of who Sakura is, and thus, in turn, considers our <em>kawaii</em> card captor his enemy and rival over the Clow Cards. Why? Because he has the right to the cards and, by birthright, should belong to him.</p>
                         <p>He is a foreign exchange student from Hong Kong with only one thing in his mind: retrieve the Clow Cards and the Clow Book and return them to his family back home. He is a member of the famous and powerful (not to mention heavily loaded, a lot more than the Daidoujis) Li Clan of sorcerors in China, and the direct descendant of Clow Reed, the half-Chinese, half-English wizard who created of the Clow Book, Clow Cards, and the guardians Kero and Yue. Not only that Syaoran has the birthright as the rightful heir to the cards, but he also possesses magical powers of his own without relying on the Clow Cards.</p>
                         <p>He will stop at nothing until he gets his hands on the Clow Cards, even if he has to take them by force (his first meeting with <strong>Sakura Kinomoto</strong>). While everyone has strong admirations for Sakura, Syaoran is the opposite. Sakura's older brother Touya, as well as Kero (despite he was created by Syaoran's ancestor), earned their ultimate dislike against him, and to no surprise, Syaoran dislikes both of them in return. He is also cold, critical, somewhat egotistic, and overall socially awkard. He often criticizes Sakura for her clumsiness and her amateurism towards the Clow Cards, competes with Sakura with everything else that doesn't involve the Clow Cards (such as <strong>Yukito Tsukishiro</strong>'s attention), pays no attention to Tomoyo or anyone who gives attention to him, insults and fights with Kero, competes with Touya with anything, and of all that, he only made one friend in the beginning (<strong>Takashi Yamazaki</strong>) whom he could trust. He also has a cousin and childhood friend, <strong>Meiling Li</strong>, whom he is close to, but nothing more than just friendship.</p>
                         <p>In the manga, he lives by himself in a (lush?) apartment, doing all the household chores by himself (which is quite uncommon with rich kids). In the anime, he lives in that same apartment with his butler and mentor, <strong>Wei Wang</strong>, and in a brief period of time, his lovestruck cousin, Meiling. Sakura always admired him for his independence, his being disciplined, and his skills and abilities at other things not related to the Clow Cards, to the point where she can no longer see what he has and rather sees him more for who he is.</p>
                         <p>And, just like Sakura, Syaoran also has his weaknesses. He seems to get startled easily and he blushes constantly without even realizing it himself. He blushes whenever he is near Yukito, on the same level as Sakura's blushing and floaty feeling towards him. His pride may get in the way of his thinking, but deep inside, he can be kind and caring to those close to him. The more he spends time with Sakura, whether rivaling against her or working together as allies, the more he begins to develop something a lot more than just a friend.</p>

               <p>We've all heard of this one important lesson. <em>Love your enemy, as much as you love your friend.</em> It's also a common theme among us <em>shoujo manga</em> enthusiasts, where our would-be lovers start off hating each other, and then develop into something a lot more special. Most of the time, we're already seeing the development. Sometimes, it would just hit us at the least expected times. And then, some of us would start to ponder, <em>what the heck just happened?</em> But in the end, we all react with the very sweet <em>awwww...</em></p>
               <p>It usually means, even though we have conflicting views, or that we see each other as competition, we still give them the same utmost respect and treat them as such as we would with our own friends and loved ones. Sometimes, our own friends can become our enemies, and they may be the worst kinds. We didn't have to get our relationships past through friendship with our enemies, but then again, love works in its mysterious ways.</p>
               <p>In a way, that's how I would describe Sakura &amp; Syaoran's young and budding love story. Sakura started off as being fresh and naive with everything that was going on with the Clow Cards, and she didn't choose to become the future Master of the Clow, the one to take place of its creator, the powerful and mysterious half-Chinese English sorceror, Clow Reed. Syaoran, on the other hand, the Clow Cards, its history, and legacy was already born within his blood. He had to keep his pride high and focus clean to retrieve the Clow Book and the Clow Cards to himself because of his birthright. After all, you wouldn't want to shame your family and your ancestors and lose to some unknown stranger, right? But then, what happens if you do?</p>
               <p>And yet, again, love works in its mysterious ways.</p>
             <h5 class="mainhead2">From Enemies to Rivals</h5>
               <p>Sakura thought that capturing and restoring all the Clow Cards would be the only goal that she would have. Kero knew it from the beginning that he saw something special about her the first time she mysteriously opened the Clow Book, resulting in him waking up from his slumber. He knew somehow that she was connected to his former master, Clow Reed, and thus, he chose her to be the one to capture all the Clow Cards scattered around and about. Kero observed that the more she captured them, the more her own magic begins to grow, and thus, he believed that she would be the heir to the power of Clow Reed, and he made sure that someone so positive and optimistic as Sakura does become that new heir.</p>
               <p>But then, no one expected that the <em>true</em> heir to the Clow would suddenly arrive from out of the blue. Not Sakura and not even Kero himself. No one expected that a prominent member of Clow Reed's family, the one called Syaoran Li, to arrive in Japan with only one goal in mind. No one expected that this pint-sized magician-warrior would do anything at all costs to get those cards, even to the point where he would take them by force. That was his intent right after Sakura refused to hand him over the Clow Cards she collected from the past after his first meeting and confrontation during his first day of school in Tomoeda. When Sakura refused to give the cards to him, Syaoran refuses to accept her refusal.</p>
               <p><em>Give me the Clow Cards now! If not, I will have to take them myself whether you like it or not!</em></p>
               <p>Because of that one encounter that Syaoran made two more enemies to deal with: Sakura's older brother Touya, for spotting him about to attack her, and the guardian Kero, for the same reason. Even later, he finds the mysterious but kind substitute math teacher recently arrived from England (England?!), Kaho Mizuki, a hostile and suspicious being, partially because Sakura also found herself happy and <em>floaty (hanyaaa~n!)</em> whenever she is around her. To make it short, it seems that whoever becomes close or kind to his enemy is also an enemy. It's kind of surprising that he found himself neutral with Sakura's best friend Tomoyo and all her other friends who have no knowledge of the Clow Cards, despite of that outlook.</p>
               <p>Then again, our two heroes were only at the elementary school age of ten. Do these kids know any better than to show respect when another person says no?</p>
               <p>After Kero gave her a little history lesson about Clow Reed, and revealing to her that Syaoran is the direct descendant of Clow Reed himself, the first thing that Sakura thought was that she should've given the cards to him. The little guardian simply reminded her that regardless of the bloodline, things don't exactly work that way. If Syaroan was the true heir to the Clow Cards, then there was no way that Sakura could've opened the Clow Book, whether if it was by accident or on purpose. Kero gave her some hints that Clow Reed doesn't choose the rightful heirs by bloodline itself, but by the worthiness that is way beyond bloodline. The first time Sakura got herself into another card-capturing mission with Syaoran hanging around, the first thing she felt was intimidation to his impeccable magic and battle abilities. After that one mission, Sakura refused to be pushed around by kids like him. She was going to show him how a real Card Captor was all about in the upcoming future.</p>
               <p>Sakura wasn't like Touya and Kero when it comes to Syaoran. She was intimidated by him at first, but rather than giving the same hostile aura to him as he did to her, she did the opposite: reach out to him and see him like any another normal human being. But then again, what is a normal human being? Syaoran isn't exactly normal himself, and that was one thing that Sakura would have to tackle, in addition to capturing all the missing Clow Cards that is. She didn't want to know Syaoran as just the descendant of Clow Reed, but she wants to know Syaoran as himself.</p>
               <p>As the successful card capturing continues with Sakura, his failures for hunting down for the Clow Cards was becoming eminent for Syaoran, which frustrated him, and of course, his pride of his birthright beginning to hurt. His hostility with Sakura was beginning to break past the Clow Cards. For him, it was becoming personal.</p>
             <h5 class="mainhead2">From Rivals to Allies</h5>
               <p>Syaoran wasn't exactly the most outgoing and sociable person you could ever meet, despite of all the attention he was getting without even trying (girls thinking he's attractive, boys getting jealous or envious of him being skilled at (almost) everything). Sakura, on the other hand, was only sticking to her duties along with Kero's advice and Tomoyo's guidance, and if possible, without any distractions. When Syaoran realized that his attempts of capturing the cards himself is going in the dumps, he couldn't help himself but to get a lot more cold and competitive than he already is.</p>
               <p>His new friend, the school's biggest compulsive liar named <strong>Takashi Yamazaki</strong>, got Syaoran (and Sakura) into some heaps of trouble when he gave Syaoran the idea that <em>the game of badminton was invented to replace a one-on-one duel between two rivals</em>. In P.E. class, Syaoran insisted to the P.E. teacher that he would challenge Sakura in a duel in badminton, in which their match lasted the entire period (neither of them won, showing that the two have equal level of athleticism with each other). That was just a few of the scenarios in which both Sakura and Syaoran end up pitted against each other in a series of "duels": swimming, cooking, marathon running, even Syaoran does all he can to disrupt Sakura's moments with her crush, Yukito, convinced that he was also feeling the same way for the teenager (and then end up running away afterwards).</p>
               <p>(Hilarious) "duels" aside, as Sakura continued to capture as much cards as she can, while Syaoran continued to disrupt Sakura's progresses by belittling her, insulting her, or even try to race her to get to the cards first, the cards they encounter become a lot more difficult, as each card poses a threat that can endanger humanity in their little town of Tomoeda. In the anime, Syaoran's luck turned around when his cousin, the ultra-possessive martial artist <strong>Meiling Li</strong>, arrived in Hong Kong to assist him in capturing the cards, but at the same time, also tries to antagonize Sakura for a variety of reasons: first, she wanted Syaoran to succeed as the true heir of the Clow, and, second, prevent Sakura and Syaoran from getting "too close" to each other (she claims that she is Syaoran's fiancee). Lucky for her, Sakura was too naive of her conflicting reasons, let alone knowing what the word "fiancee" really meant. With a new ally, Syaoran and Meiling (who has no magical powers of her own but a capable athlete and a martial artist) are now equal to Sakura and Tomoyo (who also has no magical powers of her own and is physically weak, but her practical skills with sewing and her family business helps her provide the latest technology and equipment that would help Sakura with her battles).</p>
               <p>Sadly for them, their two-on-two rivalry isn't helping against the dangerous personalities of the cards. Sakura easily captured the non-violent cards in the beginning, but the next cards she needed to capture did not see any borders between right and wrong, and their violent nature continued to endanger the peace and prosperity of their town and the people around them. Sakura, who only relies on her captured Clow Cards and her slowly-budding weak magic, was no match for these more critical cards, let alone finding them (even though she's beginning to sense them by herself as her powers continue grow). Syaoran can easily detect Clow Card presence a lot faster on his own or with the help of his <em>Rashinban</em> board and can also take on these turbulent cards down using his own powers, but has no abilities to capture and seal them himself. Even though Kero hates the idea, Sakura and Syaoran began to use their skills together to take down one perilous Clow Card.</p>
               <p>For both Sakura and Syaoran, it was no longer about which one of them becomes the true Master of the Clow. It was now all about saving everyone from danger and restoring peace in their little town. From then on, the pair left their rivalries behind and became this title: allies of heroes.</p>
            <h5 class="mainhead2">From Allies to Friends</h5>
               <p>With this new-found alliance, Sakura and Syaoran succeeded in saving the day while capturing Clow Cards at the same time. Syaoran weakens the cards and Sakura captures and seals them, with the help and advice from Kero and Mizuki-sensei, who also turned out to be a Shinto shrine maiden with <em>some</em> related powers of her own. What a dynamic duo!</p>
               <p>And along with this alliance comes the early budding of a new friendship. Tomoyo may be happy to see this new friendship forming between the two former rivals, but there are still a few who aren't happy. Kero is still one of them (he still hates that Chinese kid's guts), Touya is another (he's suffering from a case of the "little sister complex" and still doesn't trust this brat), and lastly, Meiling (her fear of seeing her beloved Syaoran getting "too close" to Sakura is coming true). But neither of them couldn't deny the power and domination that these two heroes have over these annoying, troublesome cards, especially if they possessed magic that would give danger to anyone in sight without awareness. The pair become more experienced dealing with the cards, both of their powers began to grow a lot stronger, and in turn, their friendship with one another is slowly beginning to develop from "not standing one another" to "unable to survive and succeed without one another."</p>
               <p>Then finally, all 19 cards (52 in the anime) have finally captured, sealed, collected, and restored in the Clow Book. What came next? Kero's other half, the second guardian named <strong>Yue</strong>, emerges before their eyes, and not just that, out of all the people the two tried not to get involved in, Yue had to wake up from the one person both of them "love" the most: Yukito. In addition, Kero also restores his original form (in Kero's own words, his "awesome, kick-ass <em>real</em> form.") that he always bragged to Sakura in the process. But unlike Kero, who deliberately chose Sakura to be the new heir to the Clow, Yue, on the other hand, was not very open with the choice. As the judge of the two, Yue throws a challenge at Sakura to prove her worth to the Clow Cards. In the anime version, Yue challenges <em>both</em> Sakura and Syaoran to prove themselves; which one of the two is the most worth of the Clow Cards? There was only one way to decide that: defeat Yue in a one-on-one duel with everything they've got--- magic, abilities, wits, everything.</p>
               <p>Are Sakura and Syaoran back to being rivals again? Think again.</p>
               <p>Yue chose Syaoran to go first, being the descendant of his former master, Clow Reed. His birthright was at stake at this duel, and now he finally has a chance to show the world why he is the rightful heir to the Clow. Unfortunately him and that mindset, Syaoran failed to defeat Yue. Rather than feeling relief, Sakura cried in sadness for him, but in turn, it was up to her to finish the challenge. All that Sakura wanted was for the whole Clow Cards ordeal to be over and done with, and with her battles, her thoughts of her family, her friends, the people of their little town, and Syaoran were the only things in her mind now. Her heart, kindness, optimism, and determination helped her powers grow, more than enough to defeat Yue in his duel.</p>
               <p>Yue was finally convinced that an average Japanese girl with a lot of spunk and smiles officially becomes the rightful heir to the Clow. In addition, Syaoran gracefully admitted defeat, recognizing Sakura as the new heir to the Clow Cards, realizing his mistakes from the beginning. He planned on facing defeat and sharing the bad news to his family by heading back home to Hong Kong with his head up, but after a brief visit by Clow Reed's spirit and his explanation as to why he chose a "nobody" from Japan, rather than recognizing his own kin, and Tomoyo's intuition that someone may arrive to be a new rival, Syaoran decided to stay in Tomoeda a little bit longer than planned. Sakura may be the new heir, but the cards themselves don't quite recognize her as the true master yet. She had to use her own powers (which are still weak at this point) to "convince" the cards that Clow Reed is no longer the master, and that they all must look to her as the new master. In order for her to "convince" them, she must convert all of the cards she collected into her <em>own</em> cards, or in short, <em>Sakura Cards</em>.</p>
               <p>Syaoran can tell that Sakura would need all the help that she can get to accomplish the conversion, and thus, another reason why he decided to stay. Little did anyone know that there was another reason for Syaoran's need to stay in this strange little town longer than he expected, even Syaoran himself begins to question his sudden constant blushing without Yukito being around. Can it be because of this precious green-eyed girl who never treated him differently from the beginning other than a friend?</p>
               <p>Luckily for both Sakura and Syaoran, Yue knows his <em>dormant</em> form is Yukito, but Yukito himself doesn't know anything about Yue, or even the Clow Cards for the matter. But, what would happen if he found out?</p>
               <p>Lastly, Clow Reed's final message to the two young heroes: to be sure keep their guard up high, because he (Clow Reed) is afraid that <em>he may cause the both of them some trouble in the near future</em>. What did the great sorceror mean by that?</p>
            <h5 class="mainhead2">From Friends to . . . "Best" Friends</h5>
               <p>Isn't it interesting that one person, or a few people, can make a difference in the lives of two people, especially when it comes to their relationship to one another?</p>
               <p>This particular thought became factual for both our heroes when a mysterious new student arrives in Tomoeda Elementary some several months later after our heroes successfully restored all of the missing Clow Cards to its book. His name is <strong>Eriol Hiiragizawa</strong>, and if we're talking about <em>deja vu</em> here, Eriol is a foreign exchange student from England (England again? Like how Clow Reed was born and raised in England, and Kaho Mizuki, who returned from England and then went back after our heroes collected the Clow Cards?). And to top it off, Touya and Yukito gain a new student in their class who goes by the name of <strong>Nakuru Akizuki</strong>, who just couldn't leave Touya alone. With Nakuru clinging on to Touya everyday, Eriol, on the other hand, showed off his princely "English gentleman" personality on our sweet darling card captor. It was a good thing that Syaoran decided to stay a little longer in Tomoeda instead of heading back home to Hong Kong in defeat, because this Eriol lad was already reminding our little wolf Syaoran that he was no longer <em>the</em> charming foreign exchange student in class.</p>
               <p>What on earth was going on here now? How is it that whenever Eriol "makes advances" on our darling Sakura, Syaoran finds himself becoming hostile to this new kid to the point that he wished he would just go away? Just who does this Eriol kid think he is for him to get close to Sakura like that? It was then that Syaoran realizes that this Eriol guy was going to get in the way of his happiness and delight with Sakura, and that he has found himself another heated rivalry against this half-Japanese English boy... wait, what?</p>
               <p>There was another thing about Eriol too. Dark-haired, indigo eyes, and a pair of glasses? To our heroes, he was just another boy. To the readers, he's got a pretty close resemblance to three others we've already met: Clow Reed, Yukito, and, not much of a surprise, Sakura's dad. Clue?</p>
               <p>Our heroes are now a little older, a little wiser, and a lot more aware of the outcome they reached after capturing the Clow Cards. Luckily for Syaoran, Sakura is still as dense as ever, especially when it comes to "things with people." She still treated everyone, including Eriol, as an important person to her, but other than that, nothing more. She still finds Yukito (even though she already knows Yukito's secret being Yue) her ideal man, but at the same time, also begins to wonder if Syaoran felt "the same" for Yukito too like how it was back then they were still rivals. Unlike Sakura, Syaoran also began to ponder himself about the events that occured before, and that he also began to understand more of Clow Reed's magic and the magic of those he created. Cards divided based on their magic, sun-based and moon-based. Clow Reed's magic balances that of the sun and the moon like yin and yang, and one fact came from it: those whose powers have similar categories find themselves attracted to each other, those with the opposite become hostile with one another. Hm... clue?</p>
               <p>Since the arrival of Eriol (and Nakuru, even though not <em>too</em> important to note), that was when Clow Reed's "predicament" begins, when dangers start to occur again, and not only that, the Clow Cards also began to react as if they were own person, refusing to work the way they should be working against their adversaries or even becoming ineffective on purpose, all for one reason: Sakura is <em>not</em> their Master Clow Reed. Both Kero and Yue realized that in order for these pesky cards to forget about their former master and must swear their loyalty permanently to their new master was to convert them, like a pagan being converted into a Christian (not trying to be religious here, just a comparison). In short, convert them from Clow Cards to what we now call as <em>Sakura Cards</em>.</p>
               <p>With Sakura's old Clow Sealing Wand converting itself to the Star Wand from their last battle, it was time for Sakura to show these cards who's the <em>real</em> boss now. Using the Star Wand, she must command the cards (and her wit) to solve and defeat all the mysterious attacks caused by a then-unknown entity. Once she succeeded in these battles, the cards she chose to battle gets converted into Sakura Cards--- her very own cards branded with her name on it. It sounded so easy, but, just like with capturing the Clow Cards from before, there were problems. First, like before, she has to convert all 19 of them (52 in the anime series). Her powers were still weak and that she easily gets exhausted from each battle, but unlike before, she was no longer alone. She now has Kero (in his original form), Yue, and Syaoran, the three with stong magical powers, alongside her to battle these disasters. As she continues to go through these battles and converting the cards, she grew a lot stronger.</p>
               <p>At the same time, without even realizing it, she becomes a lot closer to Syaoran. Syaoran, on the other hand, was beginning to figure out his feelings for her. There wasn't any other explanation as to why he gets so annoyed with that Eriol kid whenever he gets closer to Sakura aside from being jealous. In addition, he was beginning to learn more about his ancestor and the concepts of his magic, as well as the guardians themselves. He discovered (more like Yue advised him) that the only reason why he finds himself attracted (and the constant blushing) to Yukito was because of his magic's category being similar to Yue's magic (moon-based). And because of that commonality, Syaoran wasn't really attracted to Yukito himself, but to Yukito's (Yue's) magic. On the other hand, this was also the reason why he and Kero still couldn't get along, as Kero's magic is based on the sun (opposite of the moon).</p>
               <p>Because Sakura has become the new Master of the Clow, this also means that her budding magic is similar to Clow Reed's: a balance of the sun and the moon. One half of Sakura's magic (sun) should find Syaoran opposing her the way he is opposing Kero, but her other half finds him getting attracted her. Even if that was the case, Syaoran finds himself getting a lot more attracted to Sakura than a balance of a friend and an enemy. If that was a fact, what does that mean for Syaoran?</p>
            <h5 class="mainhead2">From "Best" Friends to . . . the Stuffed Animal</h5>
               <p>Sakura is getting stronger the more she converted the cards to Sakura Cards. Syaoran has become on the same level of friendship as Tomoyo (well, not to the point of him replacing Tomoyo anyway), not only assisting her in her battles, but also being all sorts of everything else: a (best) friend, a mentor (to the cards, Clow Reed's powers, the guardians, etc.), and someone whose shoulder would be open for her to cry upon. Even so, Sakura is still as dense as always, Syaoran is already close to figuring out his real feelings for her, but to everyone else witnessing the two, there was something else that they could see that is on a higher level than just friendship.</p>
               <p>In Tomoeda, there is a custom, in which if one gives a stuffed animal to the one he/she loves the most, and that the person who receives that stuffed animal names that teddy bear after the giver, the two will be together forever. Sakura, still thinking of her brother's best friend Yukito, already has an idea on how she would finally confess to him. Syaoran, on the other hand, already had his own ideas on getting Sakura to wake up from her naivete and see what's in front of her. The stuffed animal is the solution to breaking the barriers of... love?</p>
               <p>The battles became more intense, but Sakura was becoming a lot powerful and a lot wiser, to the point that she, Syaoran, and their guardians, Kero and Yue, were already suspecting the culprit behind these perilous dangers... although the readers already know that all this time, it was that Eriol kid, aided by his own two guardians, <strong>Ruby Moon</strong> (Nakuru's true form) and a <em>dark</em> version of Kero named <strong>Spinel Sun</strong>, who had been behind these attacks. In addition to that, Eriol isn't just a powerful sorceror like Syaoran, but there are clues that may be the reincarnation of Clow Reed himself. A few clues that already gave that away was his intentional closeness to Sakura (although they were positive and encouraging) and referring Syaoran as <em>"my dear little descendant"</em>. (How English! *laughs*)</p>
               <p>At this point, those close to both our heroes were already noticing the huge development of the relationship of the two. Tomoyo, somehow, already knew herself that Sakura would end up developing stronger feelings for someone whose name isn't Yukito Tsukishiro, and that she already knew that Syaoran already sorted his own feelings for Sakura, but decided to be on the sidelines for the time being until the right time came. In addition, self-proclaimed fiancee Meiling found herself being a <em>tag-along</em> on Syaoran all this time and not as a partner in capturing the Clow Cards from the beginning (after all, they failed). Her second worry for her beloved Syaoran already came true and that her chance of being together with him dissolved. But at the same time, she also wanted Syaoran's happiness be fulfilled, and the only way for her to do that was to go back home to Hong Kong. In that way, Syaoran would have all the time and space for him to prepare and face Sakura on his own.</p>
               <p>And then, there was Touya. He admitted to himself (and to Yukito) that he would probably never get along with that Chinese brat. It's not because that he is afraid that he would harm his little sister, but he mentioned something about <em>one day, someone will take the heart of my little sister, and I already know, it will be him</em>.</p>
               <p>At the final turn of the events right after all 19 cards (52 in the anime) were already converted to Sakura Cards, and the discovery of Eriol's true identity and intentions, Sakura slowly was beginning to wake up from her dense nature and finally see the reality all around her. She also began to put the pieces of the puzzle together with Eriol and, much to a surprise to everyone, her overly clueless father, Fujitaka. Even Kero, Yue, and all the other guardians could see the resemblance. Sakura's feelings for Eriol was the same as her feelings for her father. In fact, even her feelings for Yukito was the same with her father but refused to see it (not yet anyway). We now learn why Eriol, as <em>a</em> reincarnation (note the article "a") of Clow Reed, began to make trouble for Sakura, her friends, and the cards. Clow Reed really wanted to pass on his powers and legacy to Sakura, but in order for that to happen, Sakura must believe in herself and rely on her newly-developed powers and the guidance of her guardians and friends to <em>truly</em> make the cards solely hers. Now that she succeeded, Eriol's work was now complete, and that Clow Reed's spirit can finally rest in peace while living inside two living beings: Eriol and Sakura's father, Fujitaka. (In the anime, Eriol is the sole reincarnation of Clow Reed, and that Fujitaka had nothing to do with the connection to Clow Reed. I prefer the manga better.)</p>
               <p>The stuffed animals were made and it was time for Sakura to finally confess her feelings to Yukito, but as expected (from us readers), Yukito rejects her feelings. First, he <em>knows</em> that her heart really belongs to someone else (Syaoran) and that her love for him is different. Second, Yukito also has someone else whom his heart belongs to. I'll let you judge on that when you do read the manga (or watch the anime). Confused and heartbroken, she left with tears in her eyes. For her, normally she would run to someone more understanding of her feelings for Yukito, which is Tomoyo. But this time, she ran to someone that none of us expected: Syaoran. With that one moment alone, Sakura was getting a few hints about her true feelings, not with Yukito, but the boy whose shoulder she was crying on, and yet, all she could do was to say thank you for being there.</p>
               <p>After that moment, Tomoyo finally opened up to Syaoran about what she observed. After a few words of advice, Syaoran finally decided to <em>face the enemy</em> by confessing his feelings to Sakura. Eventually, he faced her with just three simple words: <em>"I love you."</em> And after he left, he also said to Sakura: <em>"I will wait for your answer."</em> Sakura found herself at a loss of words, and now the deep contemplation begins for her. She didn't even have a clue on where to start.</p>
               <p>School came, and Eriol announced that he will be returning to England. But before he did, he gave a piece of advice to Sakura. He said in the lines of <em>"I know that parting is sad, but I can see that you are also happy that we've met. However, think deeper when you realize that you would feel pain when someone more important to you will part from you."</em></p>
               <p>Sakura ran to Syaoran's apartment to give her his answer, but what she discovered was something she did not expect. There were movers bringing in furniture among things, and when she asked Syaoran who was moving in his apartment complex, he answered to him that he is moving out and that he will be returning back home to Hong Kong on the next day. When Eriol left for England, she did not feel any form of pain but thanked him instead for everything. But with Syaoran going back to Hong Kong? More tears fell, admitting to herself: <em>"No... I don't want Syaoran to leave..."</em> She finally began her quest for some answers finally began by asking those who are close to them, as well as those with experience with love: Tomoyo, Chiharu, Rika. In the end, Yukito was the last person she confided into, and thanks to him, she finally got her answer.</p>
               <p>Sakura knew what to do. She had to hurry and build a stuffed animal for Syaoran to remember her by, and with that old Tomoeda legend, hoped that Syaoran would name her winged teddy bear "Sakura," just as how she decided to keep Syaoran's bear from the days before. At the last minute, just as Syaoran was leaving, she handed her handmade teddy bear for him. <em>"Can I call your bear 'Sakura'?"</em> was all it took for Sakura to smile, and with deep confidence, she knew that this wasn't their final goodbye. In turn, she would name the green teddy bear "Syaoran," after that warrior sorceror boy who captured her heart.</p>
               <p>There are two different endings to this story, one in the manga and one in the anime. I let you decide which ending you prefer, but both of them have one in common. Sakura and Syaoran's true feelings to each other was all decided through the stuffed animals, naming them after each other. I'll leave it at that.</p>
